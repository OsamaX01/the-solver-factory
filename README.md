# The Solver Factory Roadmap

Simple guide for beginneres to prepare for Problem-Solving Interviews. 

The problems will be mainly from Leetcode but might also include others from CSES (a powerful platform for classical problems) and Codeforces. 

## Part 1: Introduction. 

Ramp up by solving simple problems with no prerequisites.

- [Valid anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)
- [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)

## Part 2: Time Complexity

### Resources:
- [Book](https://darrenyao.com/usacobook/cpp.pdf#page=11)
- [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUUkiEllHG0)
- Check this code to and try to answer the time complexity for each pattern [Link](https://github.com/OsamaX01/the-solver-factory/blob/main/lecture2/solutions/guessTheTimeComplexity.md). 

### Essentials: 
- [Increasing_triplet_subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)       
    - [C++ Solution, ](https://github.com/OsamaX01/the-solver-factory/blob/main/lecture2/solutions/Increasing_triplet_subsequence.cpp) [Java Solution, ](https://github.com/OsamaX01/the-solver-factory/blob/main/lecture2/solutions/Increasing_triplet_subsequence.java) [Python Solution](https://github.com/OsamaX01/the-solver-factory/blob/main/lecture2/solutions/Increasing_triplet_subsequence.py)

### Homework
- [Reverse Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)
- [String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)
- [Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/)

## Part 3 & 4: Hash Map & Tree Map & Hash Set & Tree Set & Multisets

### Resources:
- [Book](https://darrenyao.com/usacobook/cpp.pdf#page=17)
- You might need to study Hash tables and ways to solve conflicts for direct quistions during the interview.
- Please note that set & map are hashmaps, while unordermap & unordered sets & multisets are tree from inside. Hence different functionalities & time complexity. 


### Essentials
- [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)
- [Top K](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)
- [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)
